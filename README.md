===========
About
-----
PrintSwitch is a tiny Windows utility that sits 
in the system tray to allow quick changing of the 
system's default printer.

Installation
------------
Currently, there is no download for the installer. 
A VS 2010 project is included to easily build the 
software. Also included is an [InnoSetup][1] 
script to build an installer.
